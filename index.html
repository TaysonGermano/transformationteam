                        We, the Transformation Team, are a group of like-minded Nigerians that has come together to promote
                        the agenda of a socio-economically active community organization for Nigerians in the Western Cape. As a team contesting the 2018 NCWC, we humbly present our manifesto to Nigerians in Western Cape to
                        consider and decide, if, our programmes are capable of assisting Nigerian citizens to become better
                        organized or not.<br>
                        Our manifesto is divided into two sections: the first section focus on the social programmes (community services). Our compatriots, we are proud to say that our team has identified 10 types of community services to assist Nigerians that are experiencing diverse challenges and constraints. We believe that our
                        community service plan will foster a strong and more united Nigerian community.<br>
                        Our counterpart team has stressed the need for unity amongst Nigerians. It is therefore sad that some
                        opinions circulated of late tend to portray our team as being oblivious of the need for unity. As the
                        Transformation Team, we are not against unity, in fact, our position is that unity is not an option.<br> We
                        understand and support unity and, for that reason we have shown what our team will do to promote unity
                        and to better the lives of Nigerians.<br>
                        However, it is also our belief that it is not enough to role out scores of social welfare packages without
                        correspondingly conceive of how such programmes will be supported financially.<br>
                        Besides the sustainability of the community services; our team believes that economic pursuit is the
                        overwhelming purpose for most Nigerians sojourn to South Africa. Therefore, our team thinks it is
                        imperative that the community organization (NCWC) must be able to creatively facilitate that common
                        aspiration that brought us from Nigeria.<br>
                        Consequently, the second part of our manifesto outlines an economic programme for Nigerians in the
                        Western Cape. We introduce Nigerian Community Business Enterprise (NICOBE), this will be a proformal
                        chamber of commerce for Nigerians to incubate and birth entrepreneurial ventures.<br>
                        Finally, our team took the decision to compose and publish this manifesto because we want to be held
                        accountable during and after our tenure. This is the first time that our community will be having such a
                        detailed manifesto. We know that this lofty and might sound like “building castle in the air” as some has
                        said. But give us the opportunity because we are a people with passion and commitment to bring
                        transformation.

                        The NCWC is a community organization for Nigerians in the Western Cape; therefore, it has to run as a
                        community based organization with non-profit status. Our team fully appreciates the roles of community
                        organizations just as we understand the requirements to operate an efficacious non-profit organization.<br>
                        The presidential and other candidates contesting on this platform possess track record and years of
                        experience in management of non-profit organizations, be it community-based, faith-based or nongovernmental
                        organization.<br>
                        Transformation Team shall vigorously build an NCWC that has humanitarian services to Nigerians as its
                        bedrock; NCWC under our leadership will be structured to become socially relevant to the vulnerable and
                        less privilege members of our community.<br>
                        The NCWC under our trust will have the following programmes and projects:<br>
                         Organizational Visibility<br>
                         Inventory of Social & Community Structures<br>
                         Social Welfare support<br>
                         Legal Service Support<br>
                         Information & Referral Services<br>
                         Rebrand Nigerians Project<br>
                         Social Cohesion Projects<br>
                         Scholar Scheme<br>
                         Skills Acquisition Programme<br>
                        <b>(a) Organizational Visibility:</b><br>
                        We will ensure that the NCWC does not operate as a mushroom organization; one of the ways to give
                        impetus to our overall objective is to ensure that the NCWC is visible and assumes appropriate corporate
                        image.<br>
                        Our team has undertaken to ensure that the NCWC has an office within a week of being sworn in.<br>
                         Register NCWC to acquire NPO/NPC (Non-Profit Company) status<br>
                         Secure all the relevant statutory requirements<br>
                         Install telephone line<br>
                         We will set up a database of Nigerians in the Western Cape.<br>
                         We will create a very interactive website in which Nigerians can register as members of the
                        organization online from wherever they are.<br>
                         We will also create an app that allows Nigerians to register and monitor activities of the
                        organization with their smart phones.<br>
                        We will recruit Nigerian students from various universities in Western Cape to work with elected officials
                        to develop necessary administrative, management structures and operational frameworks within the first
                        month of being in office.<br>
                        <b>(b) Inventory of Social & Community Structures:</b><br>
                        Within the first month of assuming office, we shall compile a list of all social, religious and community
                        clubs/groups formed for and by Nigerians in the Western Cape. We shall engage all the leaders of these
                        groups and organizations to recognize them according to diverse socio-cultural interests.
                        We shall conduct an assessment of their leadership and operational dynamics as a build up for a Nigerian
                        Community Leadership Conference that shall run from the last week of September and terminate on 1st
                        October 2018.<br>
                        The expected specific outcomes from the leadership conference are:<br>
                         Town hall meetings: there shall be regular town hall community meetings in which leaders of all
                        the socio-cultural organizations of Nigerians will come together to x-ray the activities and
                        dynamics of the broad community and, to proffer solutions/suggestions to assist the leadership of
                        NCWC.<br>
                         Peace & Reconciliation: our team acknowledges that there are several issues, disagreements and
                        internal cracks in some of the groups and organizations of Nigerians. Because we recognize them
                        as important blocs of our community; we would set up a structure that will engage stakeholders to
                        ensure that all such issues are resolved amicably before the first quarter of 2019.<br>
                        © Social Welfare Support:<br>
                        If we are given the mandate to run the affairs of the NCWC; Welfare Officers (Chief Welfare Officer and
                        Assistant Welfare Officers) will be empowered to function as a department with 24/7 life. The Welfare
                        Department under our leadership will not operate as a reactive or interventionist mechanism; rather, we
                        shall adopt a proactive spirit.<br>
                        The welfare department will:<br>
                         Operate dedicated hotlines that are reachable 24/7.<br>
                         Form circuits group that put 50 -100 into units.<br>
                         Set-up a fund and resource unit with the Welfare Department.<br>
                         Develop working relationship with local and international NGOs that offer different humanitarian
                        services.<br>
                        <b>(c) Legal Support Services:</b><br>
                        The third component of our community services shall be focused on Legal Support Services (LSS). One of
                        the greatest challenges that our people face in South Africa is the inability to access their fundamental
                        human rights. The fact that there is a prevalent prejudice against Nigerian citizens; make even basic
                        constitutional and legal services difficult to be accessed. To address this, we shall do the following:<br>
                         Establish relationship with law enforcement agencies and strengthen the fact that Nigerians belong
                        to a community that cares,<br>
                         Engage the services of pro-bono law firms which focus on human rights<br>
                         Regularly educate Nigerians about their rights and how to respect the laws of South Africa<br>
                         Engage a qualified lawyer on a retainer service for members of the NCWC<br>
                         Provide documentary support for those that need such to aid their application for permits<br>
                         Create an archive of the experiences of Nigerians<br>
                        <b>(d) Information & Referral Services:</b><br>
                        It will be part of our tasks to refer Nigerians in need of help to other support structures like local and
                        international NGOs. We would provide an information service desk within the NCWC office so that
                        Nigerians can find information and details regarding anything that they need to do in South Africa. In
                        some instances; the difference between proper choice and mistakes that leads to failure is the right
                        information.<br>
                        <b>(e) Rebrand-Nigerians-Project:</b><br>
                        It is no secret that the dominant narrative about Nigerians in South African media is that of a negative
                        image. Our countrymen and women have been projected in very bad light. Our team will make the office
                        of the Public Relations Officer (PRO) to function as a full scale community media structure. The NCWC
                        under our custodianship shall be very proactive.<br>
                        Our PRO candidate comes with a significant experience as a media and public relations practitioner.<br>Our
                        team understands the dynamics and approach of the media fraternity and the psychology of different

                        outfits for the benefit of the community ahead of time.<br>
                        As a community outside our territory and, one that is being vilified and de-marketed by the media daily,
                        our approach is to sell, resell and always sell ourselves positively as a community. We will make sure that
                        every positive thing done by Nigerians gets the appropriate media attention.<br>

                        Our Social Cohesion Projects shall be linked to the Rebrand Nigerians Project. We will deliberately
                        market and promote our rich cultural heritage into the social fabrics of South Africans. We will facilitate
                        exchanges and collaborations between Nigerians and South Africa within social spheres using cultural
                        mediums like dance, arts and entertainment, sports, skills exchange etc,
                        As part of our social cohesion programme, we would also establish and strengthen the involvement of
                        South African women married to Nigerians. We will enhance youth groups for Nigerian children; to
                        enable them to remain connected to their roots through language, cultural practices and appreciation of the
                        historical and political developments of Nigeria.<br>
                        <b>(g) Scholar Scheme:</b><br>
                        We will develop award for children born of Nigerian parents who are in high school in an around the
                        Western Cape. Once in a year, we will organize a special award for outstanding achievement in designated
                        areas ranging from school work to sports and political studies. Our scholar scheme will support Nigerian
                        scholars at primary, high and tertiary levels of education.<br>
                        We will make available Nigerian language literatures of their mother tongue in various printed and digital
                        format for them to learn how to greet and say few words at the start. A child who show considerable
                        improvement in our scholar scheme project will receive gift and a certificate of recognition from NCWC
                        for his or her effort
                        Nigerian University students in University of Cape Town (UCT) Stellenbosch University, Cape Peninsula

                        Our goal is to use this and other projects to reach out to the Nigerian academics and intellectual band to
                        become active within the community and, at the same time use it as project to entrench unity and foster
                        mutual cohesion amongst us. This event will create memories and images that our children will cherish
                        long into their adult lives.

                        <b>Sustainability:</b>
                        While the Transformation Team recognizes the importance of a viable community organization, it is
                        imperative to consider the following factors:<br>
                        <b>i.</b> Non-profit organizations are increasingly adopting social entrepreneurial approaches, because it is
                        no longer fashionable to depend on voluntary contributions, grants and donors for their activities.<br>
                        In the present dispensation; organizations are developing more sustainable means of generating
                        income for their operations. Our team believes that we cannot effectively deliver all the
                        community services mentioned above, if we have to depend on the conventional method of
                        running non-profit organizations.<br>
                        <b>ii.</b> Secondly, our team does believe that the NCWC should function as community gathering where
                        Nigerians come together to exchange and bemoan about our pains, deprivations, challenges and
                        the limitations that hinder us from achieving our personal economic aspirations and the primary
                        purpose that brought us to South Africa.<br>
                        In this regard, Transformation Team has chosen to also focus on building an economically active
                        community organization. It is our considered view that Nigerians will gain more respect from out host
                        country, if, the community can adopt the spirit of self-help and aspiration to prosper collectively
                        The Reality:<br>
                        Transformation Team recognizes that South African economic fabric is woven in formal sectors: our
                        host nation values skills and craftsmanship, artisanship and creativity, ingenuity and inventions, education
                        and technology, management and professionalism, etc. The productivity and fertility of South Africa can
                        only be tapped; based on our ability to strategically position our community members to harness the
                        formal structures and frameworks. Our team believes that Nigerians have a lot of contributions to make to
                        South Africa; but our economic activities must be made to align with the South African formal sector.
                        Transformation Team are strongly convinced that our host country will be more receptive to Nigerians,
                        if, we can convince the society that we are here to add economic value and, to assist to better the lives of
                        the citizens of our host country. We have a passion to use NCWC platform to help Nigerians to take their
                        rightful place by making tangible contribution(s) to South Africa. We will lead NCWC to achieve this
                        goal through Nigerian Community Business Enterprise (NICOBE).<br>
                        <b>Nigerian Community Business Enterprise (NICOBE)</b><br>
                        The NICOBE will be the business and entrepreneurship structure whose purpose is to assist Nigerians
                        initiate and develop entrepreneurial ventures. NICOBE shall function in the format of a chamber of
                        commerce where ideas, projects and business aspirations from Nigerians are given impetus. NICOBE will
                        have a more robust dynamics and practical support than the typical chamber of commerce.<br> 
                        NICOBE will start with a group of business-minded members of NCWC. NOCOBE members will pool
                        resources together. Our strategy is to use collective-funding (crowd funding) to raise finance structure
                        within 12 months from the day of inception. The amount generated will be managed as a revolving capital
                        to aid businesses and ideas that are part of the NICOBE. This is our major value propositions for
                        Nigerians in this election scheduled to hold in July 2018.<br>
                        Transformation Team conceives NICOBE because loans are not easy to secure by businesses owned by
                        foreigners. You will agree with us that South Africa is primarily committed to uplift and empower its
                        citizens. The burden to help its citizens overcome the legacies of apartheid is huge. We cannot blame our
                        host government if we are not a priority of both government and financial institutions. While this is a
                        constraint in one instance, the Transformation Team sees it as an opportunity to deploy our Nigerian
                        creativity. Instead of waiting for help, let us become our help and, also help to solve South Africa’s socioeconomic
                        challenge.<br>
                        Amongst other services, NICOBE will provide and create a data base of Nigerian owned businesses and
                        service providers: actively promote and encourage our community population to always make use of our
                        Nigerian craftsmanship like plumbers, welders, electricians, carpenters, builders, etc.
                        NICOBE will be used as the proverbial stone that kill more than a single bird at the same time:<br>
                         Empower Nigerians to play active part in the growth of South African economy on one hand,<br>
                         Provide a common resource support for one another,<br>
                         Flourish as entrepreneurs through collective efforts,<br>
                         Change the perception about Nigerians in South Africa and,<br>
                         Make ourselves more receptible to our host country.<br>
                        The idea of NICOBE is to enhance a win-win situation for everyone. Profits will go to individuals who
                        contribute into the funds and, availability of loan/funding support for Nigerian businesses. On the other
                        hand; part of the profit will be used for skills development of Nigerians who are roaming the streets due to
                        lack of skills-set needed for them to be visible in the South African job market.<br>
                        <b>Nigerian Skills Acquisition Programme (NSAP)</b><br>
                        The skills development funds contributed through profits generated through the NICOBE platform will be
                        housed under Nigerian Skills Acquisition Programme (NSAP). Through NSAP, we shall drive and
                        encourage Nigerian community to become suppliers of skills. We will champion an advocacy programme
                        that get Nigerians, especially those who newly arrive the country to become skilled within the South
                        African context. Nigerians will be supported to be active and visible within the skilled band of South
                        African labour market.<br>
                        Our team if given the leadership of NCWC will use the NSAP advocacy programme to:<br>
                        (a) Partner with skills acquisition centers; to solicit for discounted training for members of the
                        community who wish to gain different types of skills<br>
                        (b) We will also make NSAP a project that source both corporate and private donor funding to achieve
                        its goal
                        We shall use NSAP to redirect Nigerians that are constrained in illicit trades into other noble professions.<br>
                        We will organize workshops and presentations that will help drive this message home to our community
                        members.<br>
                        NSAP will identify community members who are already qualified in various vocations and engage them
                        to join NICOBE. We will help to promote and support their businesses so that they will be able to support
                        vulnerable members of NCWC. They will contribute to NSAP and also help to train those that have no
                        skills but are willing to learn.<br>

                  <p>
                    <b>We, the Transformation Team, a group of like-minded Nigerians that have come together to promote the agenda of a socio-economically active community organization; humbly present our comprehensive manifesto to Nigerians in the Western Cape to consider and decide, if, our programmes are capable of assisting Nigerian citizens to become better organized or not.</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Nigerians constitute one of the largest groups of foreigners that have become part of the South African population. As citizens from one nation, compatriots organize themselves through community organizations according to their ethnic, local government and states of origin. Besides these smaller units; Nigerians in the Western Cape have for the past 20 years been organizing themselves under different umbrella organizations like Nigerian Community Forum (NCF) and Nigerian Union Western Cape (NUWC).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Due to the problems that plagued the inclusiveness and sustainability of previous organizations, in July 2017, His Excellency, Mr. Godwin Adama; who is the head of the Nigerian Consulate General to South Africa; facilitated a process that motivated over 30 Nigerian leaders of thought to arrive at the decision to initiate a new organization known and called Nigerian Community Western Cape (NCWC). 
                    Consequently, the NCWC is will be holding its inaugural election to select Nigerians who will become office bearers to drive the affairs of Nigerians in Western Cape for three years. 
                    And, our group, known as and called Transformation Team is one of the contesting teams. Our team is led by Chief. Hon. Austine Kedi-Ewroh, Hon. Cosmos Echie and other prominent Nigerian men and women resident in the Western Cape.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Transformation Team is a group of like-minded Nigerians that came together to run for different offices of the NCWC. We are people of diverse backgrounds but unified by our common vision to build a strong umbrella organization for Nigerians in the Western Cape.

                  <h4>Our Goals And Motivation</h4>
                  <p>
                   Transformation Team is a collection of persons who are determined to re-write the narrative about our citizenry in South Africa. Members of Transformation Team came together to harness skills, expertise and commitment; to propel the ideology of collectivity and, synergy to facilitate transformation amongst Nigerians in Western Cape. We have set for ourselves the following as our goals:
                  </p>
                    <p><b>To assist in correcting the negative narrative about Nigerians which continue to be dominant in South African media and public spaces,</b><br></p>
                    <p><b>To promote Nigerian survival instinct: the endowed entrepreneurial spirit, the “never-say-die” attitude which underscores the appetite and, doggedness for success.</b></p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, our team adopts the mantra: “to build an NCWC that is Socio-Economically active”. When elected, we shall operate a viable community owned Non-Profit Organization (NPO) on one hand, and, also set up a business arm that advances the economic interests of Nigerians.<br>
                    Our goal seats on two pillars: community services and economic activities. The first pillar refers to the services that we shall render to the members of NCWC. The second pillar will comprise of initiatives that will make Nigerians become visible and active in the mainstream economy of South Africa: we will adopt a two-prong approach to manage the affairs of NCWC.
